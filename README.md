## Project Description

These are unfinished bots I made for fun.

### Neploid

  My first bot with some basic functions and one that links you to a random page in NHentai.

### Arkash
  
  My attempt at making a Discord Gacha RPG game inspired by Mudae and Granblue Fantasy.

### Yugibot

  My attempt at making a bot for Yu-Gi-Oh RPGs with deck generation from a limited set of cards and pack opening, with only the former implemented.
